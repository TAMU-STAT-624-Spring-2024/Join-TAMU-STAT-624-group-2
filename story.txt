Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Sid,

I am writing to you from a small room spaceship in a far away galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a blue rocket in December. There are 1,000,000 rats and thousands of them are here! In the
kichen there is a pool full of ducks. I fall asleep each night on a big bed of
water and dream of beautiful angels. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
